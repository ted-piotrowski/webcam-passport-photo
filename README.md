## How to

1. Stand next to a solid background like a wall
2. Place laptop or hold phone at eye-level
3. Don't forget to look up at the camera
4. Photos produced are `600x600` pixels or `2x2"` printed at `300dpi`
5. Print at home or CVS, Wallgreens, RiteAid for less than `$0.50`

## Philosophy

Laws are important, but they should not burden those ruled. The Post Office passport photo service costs $15. Here is a free alternative you can use yourself. Fork as you like.
